# Changelog

The section for a version becomes the notes of its GitHub release
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`), which is cut when the version in
`package.json` reaches the default branch.

## v0.2.0

### Diagnostics: directed, and aware of distance

* The spanning ratio counts **roots** instead of weakly connected components.
  Counting components is the undirected notion, so `A -> S <- B` used to score
  1.0 although `S` has two callers; it now scores 0.5.
* New **locality** metric. The graph is condensed, the dominator tree is
  computed, and every edge gets a **lift**

  ```
  lift(a -> b) = depth(a) - depth(idom(b))
  ```

  the number of scopes `b` had to be hoisted out of `a` to stay reachable from
  its other users. 0 is a nesting edge, 1 is two siblings sharing a helper,
  more means the callers sit in unrelated parts of the program. Locality is the
  mean of `1 / (1 + lift)` and joins the tree score, which is now the mean of
  five ratios.
* **Most costly sharing** ranks by summed lift instead of caller count: in the
  self dataset `nodeRadius` (7 callers, lift 16) outranks `state` (13 callers,
  lift 13).
* The selection panel names each declaration's **natural scope** — its
  immediate dominator, where it could live if the program were a tree — and the
  lift of every edge into it.
* Surplus edges is now the number of extra incoming edges,
  `sum of max(0, indeg - 1)`.

### Physics: two forces and nothing else

* The layout is the `1/d` repulsion, with no range limit, and the edge springs.
  A spring is the only attraction, so two declarations sit next to each other
  only when something connects them.
* Removed: the gravity pull towards the origin (its equilibrium against a `1/d`
  repulsion is a uniformly filled disc, which is why every graph came out as a
  circle), the repulsion range cut-off, and `forceCenter`. No point in the
  plane is privileged; framing is the camera's job.

### Analyzer

* Calls through a **union type** (`Object.values(renderers)`) and through a
  **record indexed at run time** (`renderers[view].fit()`) now reach every
  candidate, marked inferred and drawn dashed. Nine live `Graph3D` methods used
  to look uncalled.
* `new C()` records the read of the class binding alongside the `create` edge
  to the constructor it runs, so classes are no longer roots.
* Roots in the self dataset go from 20 to 10, and all ten are module entry
  points.

### Also

* English and Japanese UI, every string through `t()`.
* Edge kinds derived from the calculus in `docs/THEORY.md`: `create`, dynamic
  dispatch, `override` / `implements`, definition time vs use time, and a
  bounded 0-CFA that lifts callbacks into calls.
* Module nodes for top-level code, a unified directory / file depth slider,
  zones fully decoupled from the physics, and a fixed 3D camera.

Still 0.x on purpose: `docs/DATA_FORMAT.md` is free to move.

## v0.1.0

First release: the D3 force-directed declaration graph, directory and file
zones, the property panel with the physics controls and the tree-likeness
diagnostics, the 3D call-height view, the TypeScript / JavaScript analyzer and
the GitHub Pages deployment.
